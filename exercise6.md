# Generating Maven Site Documentation

## Overview
Maven Site is a documentation system for Maven projects. It generates a website with various reports and information about the project. To generate Maven Site documentation, certain configurations in `site.xml` and `pom.xml` are necessary.

## Prerequisites
- Apache Maven installed
- A Maven project with a valid `pom.xml` file

## Configuration in `pom.xml`
The `pom.xml` file is the core of a project's configuration in Maven. To generate site documentation, you need to configure the `maven-site-plugin` and other relevant plugins.

### Important Sections in `pom.xml`
- **Build Plugins**: Define the `maven-site-plugin` and configure it as needed.
- **Reporting Plugins**: Configure the `maven-project-info-reports-plugin` to include various project reports.

## Configuration in `site.xml`
The `site.xml` file defines the structure and appearance of the Maven-generated site.

### Important Sections in `site.xml`
- **Project Information**: Define the project name, description, and other metadata.
- **Menu Configuration**: Set up the structure of the site's menu, including links to various reports and pages.

## Generating the Site
To generate the site, run the following Maven command in the project directory:
```sh
mvn site
